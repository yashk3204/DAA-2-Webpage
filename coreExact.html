    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This algorithm finds a Connected Dominating Set (CDS) by first performing a core decomposition of the graph G=(V,E) with help from an auxiliary graph Ψ=(VΨ,EΨ). It locates the (k′′,Ψ)-core by using pruning criteria to focus only on the denser parts of the graph. Then, it initializes empty sets for connected components C, the final solution D, and a temporary set U. It also sets two bounds, a lower bound l starting from the initial core density ρ’’, and an upper bound u based on the maximum degree in the graph.</p>
    <p>The algorithm collects all connected components of the (k′′,Ψ)-core. For each component, if needed, it intersects it further with a smaller core. It then builds a flow network by following the edge-building rules from Algorithm 1 and finds a minimum s-t cut. If the cut is empty, it skips to the next component.</p>
    <p>If the cut is meaningful, it uses binary search between l and u to fine-tune the solution. In each iteration, it builds a new flow network, finds the minimum cut, and updates l and u based on whether the cut separates only the source or a useful group of nodes. If a better connected structure is found, it updates the CDS candidate D. After all components are processed, the algorithm returns the final connected dominating set.</p>
